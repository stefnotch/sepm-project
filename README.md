# SEPM Group Project Frontend

This is the *frontend* of the ticket service website we built as a part of the TU Wien 2022 SEPM course (Software Engineering and ProjectManagement). [Many thanks to my lovely team members!](https://github.com/stefnotch/sepm-project#team-members)
The backend is not included, instead we whipped up a *mocked* version of it. Try searching for the merchandise named `cat`. 

[Check it out in action here](https://stefnotch.github.io/sepm-project/#/)
